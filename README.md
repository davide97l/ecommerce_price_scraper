# E-commerce Price Scraper

This project consists of a multifunctional tool designed to scrape the prices of a set of products from different vendors via e-commerce websites such as Taobao, Tmall, and Jingdong.
The primary function is to compare the scraped prices and identify discounted offers to assist users in finding the best deals for their desired products.

## Example

We have a list of products, for instance: `"Danish Crown Ham Slices 800g"`, `"Danish Crown Barbecue Pork 500g"`, `"Danish Crown Sauce Pork Ribs 200g"`.
These keywords are used to search the e-commerce websites.

The goal is to generate a CSV file that contains the URL of the vendor, the price, and a boolean indicating whether the price is lower than the market price.

The market price is given as a CSV file sourced from the official vendor of the products, for instance, Danish Crown.
